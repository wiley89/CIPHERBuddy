# CIPHERBuddy
Vignere Cipher:
Vignere Cipher is fully implemented and can be used with the CIPHERBuddy application.

RSA:
RSA is fully implemented and can be used with the CIPHERBuddy application.


ElGamal:
ElGamal is fully implemented and can be used with the CIPHERBuddy application.

DES:
The DES encryption and decryption is not fully functional and therefore not avaliable in the interface. 
Important steps towards its implementation are visible in the DES class.
Comments for these steps and their implementation are made throughout the code
to show the steps made towards implementation.
